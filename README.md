# Cover Letter automation with Python, Excel and MS Word

1. Figure out how **Content Control** works
```
-> you turn on the Dev Mode
    -> then add Text Content Control
    -> in properties define a tag and check 'multiple carriage'
    -> select the block and copy paste somewhere else (you can change properties to not show the content control box)
```
2. Add information from Excel through Mailing list in Word
3. Scrape information with Python and make an Excel file for Mailing list
